## Description
The program performs a simple task of printing the integer value of the EOF constant. This value is defined in the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and is used to signify the end of a file or input stream in C.

## Features
- Prints the integer value of EOF.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc -o Exercise_1_7 Exercise_1_7.c`.
2. Run the compiled program, e.g., `./Exercise_1_7`.
3. Observe the output, which will be the integer value representing EOF.

## Run the Program using MAKEFILE
1. Go to ROOT directory (cd CProgramming)
2. Run the below command.
3. make run_exercise EXERCISE="Chapter1/Exercise_1.7/Exercise_1_7.c"

## Example
./Exercise_1_7
